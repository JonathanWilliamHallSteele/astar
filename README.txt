In order to run the A Star search algorithm, change the cost matrix and the heuristic vector at the beginning of the "main" class. These inputs need to have 10x10 elements, and 10 elements respectively. The indexes of each array correspond to the following letters:

0 : A
1 : B
2 : C
3 : D
4 : E
5 : H
6 : J
7 : G1
8 : G2
9 : G2

To run the algorithm, run the main method inside of the "main" class
